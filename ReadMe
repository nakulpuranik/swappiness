Assignment : Write a programe which will avoid the swapping.

Description :
Man page states that sysctl function is discouraged for using, instead /proc/sys interface is promoted.

now we will be opening the file and changing the value of the swappiness.

It is still a request to the kernel to manipulate the swapiness value ranging from 0 to 100. default being 60
To print the current value of swapiness you can check it via command "cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness".
